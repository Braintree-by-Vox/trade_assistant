# Landed Cost
Products which are purchased for resale or for production may attract surcharges such as freight, import duties, inspection fees. Some of these costs may only be finalised weeks or months after the product has been received into the business. This can lead to stock items being incorrectly costed, and to selling prices being too high or too low.

The Landed Cost module of Trade Assistant provides tools to incorporate interim estimates for all supplimentary costs into the purchase cost of goods before the service providers' invoices have been processed, and to accrue for the costs in the general ledger.
