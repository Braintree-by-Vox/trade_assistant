# Forward Exchange Contracts

The Forward Exchange Contracts module is a tool to assist importers to manage their foreign currency exposures on purchases. It provides options to reduce the risk posed by undpredictable exchange rates, improve cash flow forecasting and provide more accurate costing on imported inventory.
