# Vendor Reconciliation
The Vendor Reconciliation module allows an Accounts Payable administrator to match the transactions which appear on the vendor’s statement of account, and confirm the amount payable to the creditor

After matching the transactions against the business’s own records, the administrator can 
* make a decision on the amount to be paid to the creditor
* make deductions from the payable balance – for example, to cover damages, recover rebates etc.
* process a payment to the creditor
* Print a remittance advice, detailing the transactions being settled
* Print a reconciliation between the balance stated by the creditor and the balance as per the business’s creditors ledger.
