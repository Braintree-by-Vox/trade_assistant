What?
A business process that compares the claims for payment from a supplier against the business’s records of what is due to the supplier
The basis on which payments are made
Performed at least once a month for every active supplier
A requirement for passing a financial audit

Why? 
To know what is owed to its suppliers
To manage disputes and discrepancies
To decide what to pay
To provide visibility for stakeholders
Auditors look closely at vendor accounts – no recons = qualified accounts = BAD! 

Who? 
Every business that buys products or services on credit. 

The challenge:
The business maintains records of what they have purchased and received from the supplier.  
The supplier maintains records of what they have supplied to the business.
The supplier’s records and the business’s records may not match :
We have disputes with suppliers:
- goods arrived damaged
- oversupplied
- price not correct
The Supplier makes mistakes
We make mistakes
