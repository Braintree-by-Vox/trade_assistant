•	Tab off the No. field. A document number will be assigned. Date fields and batch fields will be initialised.
•	Select the vendor. The vendor name, currency and statement number will be assigned

## Load transactions
The transactions to be matched come from two sources:
•	Internal – entries recorded against the vendor’s account via normal procurement processes.
•	External – entries presented by the vendor as due for payment. 

There are multiple methods to load entries due for payment:
•	Internal entries will typically be loaded by importing them from the system. Transactions that have been previously settled will be inserted into the reconciliation.
•	External entries can be captured manually, or imported from a spreadsheet template.
