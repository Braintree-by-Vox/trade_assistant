## The business challenge
As a business, we sell products and services to our customers. We issue invoices to our customers for the services provided. Usually once a month, we issue a statement of account to the customer and request payment. The business relies on timeous payments from customers to provide cash for paying suppliers and staff. It's therefore important to follow up with customers on overdue balances and to resolve disputes and queries quickly. It's also important to provide visibility of collections to stakeholders - owners, management, account managers.

## What is collection management
Collection Management is a part of the Quote-to- Cash process in the supplier-customer relationship. As a business, we need to
* confirm that invoices and other supporting documents have been received by customers.
* follow up on queries and disputes from customers to ensure quick resolution.
* follow up on promises from customers on payments to be made.

>The process is typically performed at least once a month for each active customer, by an Accounts Receivable administrator.

## Why every business should perform the Collection Management process
* It's important to have an accurate picture of what money is outstanding from customers.
* We need to manage disputes and discrepancies.
* We need to provide visibility on our creditors' liability for stakeholders - shareholders, directors, auditors, banks, account managers, customer service employees.

## How to manage collections
* Extract the unsettled invoices for the customer from our debtors ledger.
* Call the customer; ask if they have the statement and when they will be paying.
* On each outstanding invoice, record the customer's comments for example.
  * agreed to pay, and date committed to
  * missing invoice
  * dispute on delivery
* For invoices which are missing or disputed, follow up with the staff who are responsible.
* For invoices where a payment commitment has been agreed, make a note to follow up a day or two before the agreed payment date.

## The Braintree Collection Management module for Business Central
You can make use of the Collection Management module of Business Central to manage your collections process.
* Assign an Accounts Payable administrator to each customer account.
* Use the Collections dashboard to provide a live age analysis, with drill-down capabilities to quickly access the transaction details.
