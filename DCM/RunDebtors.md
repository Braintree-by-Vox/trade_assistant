Against each document, you can record information about the status of the document:

- Dispute: tick on this column to indicate that the customer is disputing the invoice.
- Reason Code: select a reason for the dispute from the drop down list.
- Promise to pay: tick on this column to indicate the customer has promised to pay the invoice. When you do this, the column ‘Promised to Pay Amount’ will be populated with the outstanding amount on the invoice, and ‘Promised to Pay Date’ will be populated with the default next contact date. These columns can be edited if necessary.
- Transaction comment: you can enter additional information or feedback from the customer.
